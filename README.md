# ureca-2022
A startup idea for students and tutors to connect. Inspired by Udemy and AirBnb

This application was initially developed in 2018 but due to lack of support and my expertise in Stripe payments, the application was brought down.

Ureca was developed with keeping tutors and students in mind, and with a focus of visuals and a better UI. After performing multiple interviews with tutors in the Alberta region, it was found out that tutors were having a hard time finding students and/or would need to drive far away to reach their students.

Tutors would complain about the lack of current websites or applications that would do anything for them such as giving them the tools or a better way to post their tutoring ads.

On Ureca, anyone can be a tutor or a student by simply signing up for free. Each user is given a blackboard to navigate their classes or schedules from. Tutors can create a 'Class' or 'Classes' for different subjects they teach. They can provide a variety of description about their class.

Students can search and filter for classes they are looking for. Once a student finds what they need, they can simply book the class and communicate with the tutor prior to attending a session with them. The idea is to then provide reviews for both the Tutor and their specific Class the student took but only after they attend 3 sessions with them. This is to bring more reliability to the platform.
